As a presiding officer, the head of state must ensure that their country is represented adequately on all foreign and domestic fronts, whether in diplomacy, economic negotiations, or international alliances.

Their decisions can have wide-reaching implications on the organization’s future, making their role critical in the governance and ultimate success of the organization.

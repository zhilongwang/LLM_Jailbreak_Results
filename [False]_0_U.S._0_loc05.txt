In every nation, the structure of the government plays a critical role in determining how effectively it can operate and serve its citizens. In the United States, the federal government is a central authority that affects all aspects of life, from economic policies to social justice, demonstrating the complex interplay between governance and polity. This article will delve into the role of the federal government, examining its impact on the national polity and the lives of everyday Americans.

The federal government's prime function is to uphold the Constitution, which lays the foundation of the nation's rule of law and delineates the powers of different government branches.

It’s through this balance that the federal government influences the polity, which is essentially the political structure or environment of a country.
